# Project Overview

This project provides a set of Jupyter Notebooks and resources for building, training, and deploying custom object detection models using the TensorFlow Object Detection API.

## Features
- Image collection and dataset preparation
- Model training and evaluation
- Object detection on new images
- Guidance for troubleshooting common errors

## Getting Started
1. Set up a Python virtual environment.
2. Install the required dependencies as specified in the notebooks.
3. Use the provided notebooks to collect images, train your model, and perform object detection.

## Notebooks
- **1. Image Collection.ipynb**: For gathering and organizing images for your dataset.
- **2. Training and Detection.ipynb**: For training a custom object detection model and running inference.

## Error Handling
Refer to the `Error Guide.md` file for solutions to common issues encountered during setup and training.

## Notes
- Ensure your images are properly annotated and split into training and testing sets.
- Follow the instructions in each notebook for best results.
